 	<p> One of the reasons why dogs are better than cats is that they are kind. Dogs are generally gentle and sweet. They always care about the onwers. <br/> They respect the onwers. However, cats are sometimes mean to the onwers. <br/> They might not respect the onwers. In addition, dogs are adorable and lovely because of their behavior. <br/> Cats might be adorable, but they can be aggressive when they feel so bad for the onwers. Therefore, dogs are way better than cats because dogs are nice and respectful. </p>
