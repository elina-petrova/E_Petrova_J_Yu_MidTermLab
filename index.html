 	<p> One of the reasons why dogs are better than cats is that they are kind. Dogs are generally gentle and sweet. They always care about the onwers. <br/> They respect the onwers. However, cats are sometimes mean to the onwers. <br/> They might not respect the onwers. In addition, dogs are adorable and lovely because of their behavior. <br/> Cats might be adorable, but they can be aggressive when they feel so bad for the onwers. Therefore, dogs are way better than cats because dogs are nice and respectful. </p>

 <p> Firstly, cats by no means aggressive. Even if somebody was able to make a cat angry, it can not hurt you as much as a dog can. Dogs are really dangerous animals - the even can kill a human! On the contrary, most cats are cute and have a nice behaviour. <br/> They sing their cat-songs when you are sick, sleep on your belly to warm you up at cold hights, and do other sweet actions that makes you life better!<br/> </p>
